  <h1>Max-A3</h1>
  <P>On October 26th, 2024, I initiated the development of the Max-A3 plotter. 
    This A3-sized machine will be the prototype for a series of 28 plotters destined for the Center for 
    Early Innovation Labs under <a href="https://ssakerala.in/">SSK</a>. In collaboration with
    <a href="https://fablabkerala.in/"> Fablab Kerala</a> and,<a href="https://startupmission.kerala.gov.in/">Kerala Startup Mission</a> , 
    we aim to provide students with an educational STEM kit. The Max-A3, named after its maximum size, 
    is designed to be both a functional plotter and a learning tool. Students can disassemble and 
    reassemble the machine to gain practical experience in CNC and machine operation.  </P>

    <p>We reviewed multiple concept designs for the machine. These included standard designs,
       a design with the back panel facing away from the user, and a design with only one side exposed.
       After considering three primary concepts, we decided to proceed with the third option.</p>
