        <p>A flatbed cutter is a type of machine that can be defined as a versatile machine because it is always modular and has multiple tools because it has to execute different operations 
            like cutting, creasing, routing, etc.. What makes a flatbed cutter unique is how easy it is to use and the numerous tasks it can perform. There are various variations of flatbed
             cutters, ranging from an expensive Zund digital cutter to an open source "Other Cutter". As a member of the Fab Lab team, I'm working to develop a flatbed cutter that schools may
              use.
            <br>As a result, it must be smaller than professional flatbed cutters while remaining safe and user-friendly. What I am trying to do is make an open-source flatbed cutter with proper documentation on how to assemble and maintain the machine.
