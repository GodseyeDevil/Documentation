    The idea of <strong>c0re_h</strong> came from necessity. It all started with my involvement in Fab Academy. I was teaching the students, and they came up
     with some ideas to build a machine. I was supposed to guide them, and it was fun. They brainstormed a lot and finally decided to make a <strong>light painting
       machine</strong>, which later came to be known as <em><a href="https://fabacademy.org/2025/labs/kochi/machine_week/machine/" target="_blank"> “Velichapad.” </a></em>
  </p>

  <p>
    It was really fun building that machine. They had some constraints—they wanted a machine with no X-axis support, meaning they needed that single 
    light dot to appear suspended in the air. The idea itself was interesting because there were two things I hadn’t tried before:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>It was meant to be a large CoreXY machine with a size of <strong>1500mm x 1500mm</strong>.</li>
    <li>A suspended gantry, with the light dot mounted on it, hanging in open space.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    These two features made the project intreasting to experiment with. The students didn’t know I was experimenting too—except Saheen.
  </p>

  <p>
    The project started and everyone worked hard. Akash finished the design quickly. Printing and assembly got done, but then came the problem.
  </p>


  <p>
    The <strong>suspended gantry</strong> became an issue. Since it wasn’t constrained along the X-axis, it started to wobble. The other axis was fine,
     but they also had a constraint to keep everything minimal and within the frame. So we needed another approach—and that’s when the idea of <strong>core_h</strong>
      came in.
  </p>

  <p>
    The <strong>core_h</strong> machine is a modified version of CoreXY. I looped the belts around the entire frame, thereby constraining it in both X and Y axes. So, in theory, if the belts are properly tensioned, the system should be stable along those two axes, allowing the gantry to suspend freely without any X-axis support.
  </p>

  <p>
    However, instead of having two gantries on either side like a typical CoreXY, this design has <strong>four gantries at the four corners</strong>. It’s still theoretical—I haven’t tried it in reality yet. Also, it’s <strong>not constrained in the Z-axis</strong>, and I still haven’t figured out how to solve that. I’m thinking about it and might work on it later.
  </p>

  <p>
    Now, if you're wondering why it's called <strong>core_h</strong>—simple: <strong>Hitler</strong>.  
    Yeah, the reason is this—while designing the kinematics, I noticed the belt pattern looked like a <strong>swastika</strong>, and I was struck by it. So I named it accordingly. I know it’s frowned upon to name it that way, but I don’t care—<strong>c0re_h</strong> it is.
